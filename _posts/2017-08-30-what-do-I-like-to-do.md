##About me

I'm kind of an oddball you could say, but hey what geek isn't?  I think a good way to keep track of people is to give everyone in the World a unique number to identify them, and feed them all into a large world wide database.  You could put small microchips under everyone's skin, so that anyone could locate them at any given time.  Wait, they already tried that once, didn't they?  The Terminator maybe?  

##What do I like to do?

* I like to cook.  Right now, I'm working on eating a very low fat diet, and am learning just what you can do with vegetables and spices.  When I get home I ask Alexa(my echo dot) how she's doing.  She gives me the updates for the day. 

* I like to write code and play at my computer obviously.  I will catch myself constantly looking up weird things in wikipedia, like how a movie that I like was produced.  I can't wait for the Football season to begin.  It's probably one of the few masculine things that I'm into.
