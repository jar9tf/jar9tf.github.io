title: My Experience at Bloc
--

##How I got started 

When I started Bloc, I was already somewhat familiar with the languages of HTML, CSS and Javascript.  I was working on a Master of Science in Web Development, but I really wanted a more hands on, immersive dive into the intricacies of web development.  I want to learn how to think like a programmer, and the different tools that were available to my craft.  

##What I have learned from Bloc

To be perfectly honest, I have far from perfected my craft, and am still learning how to think like a programmer.  I have discovered that learning the language is only half the battle.  Learning how to think like a programmer is the hardest part of all of it.  Programming is logical thinking combined with concise writing.  As in, the more you write, the more of a performance degradation.  

##What I want to explore further
I would like to explore everything that I have touched on further.  This includes learning more HTML, CSS, Javascript and especially jQuery.  I am looking forward to seeing how some of the backend processing works as well.
