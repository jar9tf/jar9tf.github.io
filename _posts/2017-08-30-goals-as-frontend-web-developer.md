title: Goals as a Frontend Web Developer
--

##What made me want to be a front end developer

I became a front end developer, because I wanted to know how to do all of the little things that make a website a website.  I have always been fascinated with how much of an art it must be to sit down and make a site that people are interested in looking at.  Think about it, so many hours of work and attention to detail, to just create a few linked pages.  

##Where am I going

I would like to be able to create professional looking websites for anything that a website can be made to do.  At the end of my Bloc training, I would like to go into a Junior developer role with some company.  I would eventually like to learn backend development as well.  I feel that having a good understanding of both the client side and backend side is essential to making an awesome website.  Learning all that I can about web development is important to me.
