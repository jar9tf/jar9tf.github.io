##Summary

With the vast number of choices people have to enjoy entertainment, it's difficult to stay competitive.  Therefore, Bloc aims to engulf the user in a more enjoyable interface.  

##Explanation
With media streaming at us constantly, customers need an efficient way to select what they want, and disregard what they don't.  Bloc Jams aims to give the customer plenty of options, and sample them.  

##Problem

Often times a customer does not know the name of a song, but knows how the song goes when they hear it.  Having a slider in the playbar will address the issue by allowing the customer to jump to a part of the song they recognize.  

##Solution

By taking a sample of the general population, it was determined that many people use seek bars when browsing through music to determine which song they were looking for.  Therefore, it seemed like the obvious choice that we include one in Bloc Jams. The seek bar was included with each album, so that the customer could play the song from the album and scan through it to find familiar lyrics.

##Results

After testing with the sample population used to gather the research, by allowing the users to use the prototype website, it was determined that customers who wanted a song that we had could find it without knowing the name of it, 95% of the time.  

##Conclusion

The results show that the seek bar addition was a success.  Not every customer was able to find what they were looking for, but 5% of the time, it was due to not having the song the customer wanted in our database.  Some of the customers wanted the ball on the seek bar to be larger, due to vision problems.  In retrospect, the ball on the seek bar was a little too small, and could be improved by making it larger.
